# Encrptify (React + Vite)

Encryptify is a versatile online platform designed for the encryption and decryption of plaintext messages. Offering a range of conversion options, Encryptify ensures secure communication by transforming plaintext into ciphertext and vice versa. With five distinct encryption methods availableâ€”Additive, Affine, VigenÃ¨re, Transposition, and One-Time Padâ€”users can select the most suitable technique for their specific security needs.




## Features

- **Additive Encryption & Decryption:** Utilizes a simple method of shifting each letter of the plaintext by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.

- **Affine Encryption & Decryption:** Implements a more complex algorithm combining multiplication and addition to encrypt the plaintext.

- **VigenÃ¨re Encryption & Decryption:** Employs a polyalphabetic substitution technique using a keyword to encrypt the plaintext, offering enhanced security.

- **Transposition Encryption & Decryption:** Involves rearranging the order of letters in the plaintext according to a predetermined pattern to generate ciphertext.

- **One-Time Pad Encryption & Decryption:** Ensures absolute security by using a random key that is at least as long as the plaintext, rendering the ciphertext unbreakable without the key.
